Imagine that you work for a payment processing service called PayFriend. PayFriend charges money receivers the following fees:

The first $100 has a flat fee of $5.
Payments over $100 (but under $1000) have a fee of 3% or $6, whichever is higher.
Payments of $1,000 (but under $10,000)  and over have a fee of 1% or $15, whichever is higher.
Payments of $10,000 and over are subject to (fees as follows):
The first $10,000 have a fee of 1%
The next $5,000 have an additional fee of 2%
Anything more will demand an additional fee of 3%
For example, an payment of $40,000 would be subject to $950 fee: 1% on the first $10,000 ($100 fee), 2% on the next $5,000 ($100 fee), and 3% on the last $25,000 ($750 tax).

Write a program that asks the user for the payment amount (real number) and outputs the fee owned (real number).
