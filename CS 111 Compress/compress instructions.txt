Compress

Write your code in the file Compress.java. Your code should go into a method with the following signature. You may write your own main method to test your code. The graders will ignore your main method:


public static String compress (String original){}

 
Run-length encoding (RLE) is a simple "compression algorithm" (an algorithm which takes a block of data and reduces its size, producing a block that contains the same information in less space). It works by replacing repetitive sequences of identical data items with short "tokens" that represent entire sequences. Applying RLE to a string involves finding sequences in the string where the same character repeats. Each such sequence should be replaced by a "token" consisting of:

the number of characters in the sequence
the repeating character
If a character does not repeat, it should be left alone.

For example, consider the following string:

qwwwwwwwwweeeeerrtyyyyyqqqqwEErTTT
After applying the RLE algorithm, this string is converted into:

q9w5e2rt5y4qw2Er3T
In the compressed string, "9w" represents a sequence of 9 consecutive lowercase "w" characters. "5e" represents 5 consecutive lowercase "e" characters, etc.

Write a method called compress that takes a string as input, compresses it using RLE, and returns the compressed string. Case matters - uppercase and lowercase characters should be considered distinct. You may assume that there are no digit characters in the input string. There are no other restrictions on the input - it may contain spaces or punctuation. There is no need to treat non-letter characters any differently from letters.
